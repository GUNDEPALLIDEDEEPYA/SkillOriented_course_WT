<font size="4">Welcome to <font size="5"><b>BEST OF INDIA</b></font> a fine Indian restaurant. We serve a selection of traditional Indian dishes, as well as, several of our own creations.

The Ingredients we use complement each other nutritionally and please the palate. All dishes are made with freshly ground herbs and contain NO MSG. Each dish is spiced to enhance its particular aroma and flavor. The spices do not make the dishes hot.

Our skilled chefs make each dish individually and we will be happy to make your dishes the way you prefer them, from mild to extra-hot. Please bear in mind that Indian food is not "fast food" and that our dishes take time to prepare. Your patience will be rewarded.</font><br>
